# Custom Dashboard Agent (Lite) — File & Folder Index

Directory of every file under `dashboarding-skills/custom-dashboard-agent-lite/`. Load this when navigating the agent, not during phase execution.

Fully self-contained — no runtime dependency on `../shared/` or the private `fde-dashboard-solutions` template repo.

## Entry Points

| `SKILL.md` | Root entry point — engagement routing and phase reference |
| `INDEX.md` | This file — full directory of all files and folders |
| `README.md` | Human-readable overview of the agent's purpose and structure |
| `references/architecture-and-state.md` | **READ FIRST (after guardrails)** — 5-phase pipeline flow, `state.md` append-only pattern, resume logic |
| `references/guardrails-lite.md` | **LOAD FIRST** — mandatory rules for data integrity, database & queries, rendering, and agent prompts |

## Local Working-Directory Convention

Every phase writes into a single flat project folder created during Phase 1 session setup:

```
./<project-slug>/
├── state.md               (single source of truth, append-only)
├── workflows/              (only if Phase 2 run)
├── dashboards/
│   ├── dashboard.html
│   ├── generate-data.js
│   └── render.js
├── skills/                 (only if Phase 4 Track A run)
├── agents/                  (only if Phase 4 Track B run)
└── docs/                    (only if Phase 5 run)
```
