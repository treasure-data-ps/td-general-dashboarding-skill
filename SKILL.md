# FDE TAIS Dashboard Builder

> **⚠️ CRITICAL: Read instructions in this order:**
> 1. **`./INSTRUCTIONS.md`** (master instructions — load first)
> 2. **`./phase-N/INSTRUCTIONS.md`** (phase-specific rules)
> 3. **`./SKILL.md`** (this file)
> 4. **Re-read after context compaction** (mandatory)

Build custom dashboards from Treasure Data databases using a **self-serve 5-phase pipeline**. Rendering is always **HTML Client** — a single portable `dashboard.html` file with data inlined at build time. No Confluence, no git branching — everything lives in one local project folder.

## How to Start

### Step 0: Engagement Type

**INSTRUCTION FOR CLAUDE:** Use the question below to route the engagement. **Wait for the user's response before proceeding to any phase.**

**Ask the user:** "Is this a new dashboard engagement, or are you resuming an existing one?"

- **Option A: New engagement** → Continue to "New Engagement Path" section below
- **Option B: Resuming existing** → Continue to "Existing Engagement Path" section below

---

#### New Engagement Path

Once you confirm this is a **new engagement**, **re-read these files immediately** (in this order):
1. **`./references/guardrails-lite.md`** — Cross-phase guardrails (293 lines)

Then follow these 2 steps:

1. **Say to the user:** "For this project, here are the 5 phases we'll work through step by step."

2. **Display the 5-phase overview:**
   ```
   📊 FDE TAIS Dashboard Builder — Project Phases

   ✅ Phase 1: Requirements + Data Discovery
      → Stage A: Understand KPIs, dimensions, filters, audience, success metrics
      → Stage B: Validate tables/columns exist in your database, recommend metrics/dimensions
      → Output: Promotion Score (0-6) + path decision (Workflow or Non-Workflow) + state.md created

   ✅ Phase 2: Deploy Dashboard Workflow  [Optional, recommended for Score 4-6]
      → Deploy a scheduled workflow, pre-aggregate metrics into SINK tables
      → Output: Pre-aggregated tables ready for Phase 3

   🎨 Phase 3: Build Interactive Dashboard (Html)
      → Query SINK tables (or source tables directly) → render a single dashboard.html
      → Test filters, performance, data accuracy
      → Output: Approved interactive dashboard as a HTML with data embedded inline and a generate-data.js data builder

   🤖 Phase 4: Automate & Deploy  [Optional but recommended]
      → Track A: Extract a reusable skill for faster future builds with context/knowledge for natural-language access
      → Track B: Deploy a companion Foundry agent for natural-language access

   📚 Phase 5: Handoff Documentation  [Optional]
      → Create Architecture, Usage Guide, Runbook, Access markdown files locally
   ```

3. **Route to Phase 1:** Read `./phase-1/SKILL.md` — it handles session setup (project slug, business goal, scoring, path decision) for both Stage A (requirements) and Stage B (data discovery). After Phase 1 completes, **route to Phase 2 or Phase 3 per the path decision** (no additional prompt needed).

**Special case — providing a `.dash` file:** If, during session setup, the user provides a Sisense/Treasure Insights `.dash` export (or JSON with a `"widgets"` array + `"datasource"` key), Phase 1 detects it and switches to a fast-track migration path — it converts the file with `./references/dash_to_html.py`, prefills requirements and data discovery directly from the export, and skips straight to building/validating the dashboard instead of asking every Stage A/B question from scratch. See `./phase-1/references/steps-1pre.md` ("`.dash` / Sisense Special Case") for the full flow.

#### Existing Engagement Path

Once you confirm this is **resuming an existing project**, **re-read these files immediately** (in this order):
1. **`./references/guardrails-lite.md`** — Cross-phase guardrails (293 lines)

Then follow these 3 steps:

1. **Ask for the project slug:**
   - "What's the project name or folder name you're resuming? (e.g. `./<project-slug>/`)"

2. **Locate the project state:**
   - Ask the user to paste the contents of `./<project-slug>/state.md` — then read it directly to recover project state
   - Display the project state so the user sees:
     ```
     🔄 Resuming: travel-dashboard

     ✅ Completed Phases:
        • Phase 1 (Requirements + Data Discovery): Score 6/6 — Workflow path

     ⏳ Next Actions:
        • Phase 2: Deploy Workflow (SINK database: test_suraj)
        • Then Phase 3: Build Dashboard

     📌 Key Details:
        • Schedule: Weekly
        • Audience: Multiple (executives + analysts)
     ```

3. **Route to the next incomplete phase based on project state:**
   - For example, if Phase 1 is complete and Phase 2 is next → use `./phase-2/SKILL.md`
   - `state.md` clearly indicates which phase to start with (append-only log of every phase's outputs)

## Recommended Model

**This skill works with all Claude models.** Best default: **Claude Sonnet 5** (balanced cost/performance across all 5 phases) or similar. Alternatives can be used but better works with good models with context:
- **Haiku 4.5:** Fast iteration on Phase 1 requirements gathering
- **Opus 4.7/4.8:** Complex Phase 4 agent development if needed

## Phase Reference Index

| Phase | Read | Key Output | Condition |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|
| **1: Requirements + Data Discovery** | `./phase-1/SKILL.md` | Promotion Score (0-6) + path decision + **state.md created** | Always |
| **2: Workflow** | `./phase-2/SKILL.md` | Workflow output tables (SINK tables) deployed + validated + **state.md appended** | Optional, recommended Score 4-6 only, user can override |
| **3: Build Dashboard** | `./phase-3/SKILL.md` | User-approved interactive `dashboard.html` + **state.md appended** | Always (after Phase 1 or Phase 2) |
| **4: Automate + Agent** | `./phase-4/SKILL.md` | Reusable skill (Track A) + Foundry agent (Track B) | Optional, either/both/neither |
| **5: Handoff Docs** | `./phase-5/SKILL.md` | 4 local markdown files (Architecture, Usage Guide, Runbook, Access & Ownership) | Optional |

**Path decision at end of Phase 1, Stage B:** (user can override the recommendation)
- **Score 0-2 (Non-Workflow):** Phase 1 → Phase 3 — skip Phase 2
- **Score 3 (Optional):** User chooses between Phase 2 (workflow) or Phase 3 (direct build)
- **Score 4-6 (Workflow):** Phase 2 first, then Phase 3

## Core Concepts

**→ Read `./references/architecture-and-state.md` for:**
- Full 5-phase pipeline flow diagram
- `state.md` append-only pattern explanation (how context flows between phases)
- When to skip each phase
- Single-session vs multi-session workflows
- Resuming at a specific phase

---

## Phase Routing

**Quick rules:**
- New engagement → Phase 1 → [Phase 2 optional] → Phase 3 → [Phase 4/5 optional]
- Resume → read `./<project-slug>/state.md` → jump to "Next Action" at bottom
- Phase 1 score = 3 → user decides: Phase 2 (workflow) or Phase 3 (direct build)

---

## Quick Navigation

| I want to... | Go to... |
|---|---|
| Start a new dashboard | `./phase-1/SKILL.md` |
| Resume an existing project | Read `./<project-slug>/state.md`, then jump to next phase |
| Convert a Sisense .dash export | `./phase-1/SKILL.md` (provide the file during Setup-E) |
| Deploy a production workflow | `./phase-2/SKILL.md` (after Phase 1 scores 4-6) |
| Build and test the dashboard | `./phase-3/SKILL.md` |
| Automate for future builds | `./phase-4/SKILL.md` (Track A) |
| Deploy a conversational agent | `./phase-4/SKILL.md` (Track B) |
| Create handoff documentation | `./phase-5/SKILL.md` |

## Security & Privacy

**STRICT RULE:** All query results must flow through rendering scripts, never into AI context. See `./references/guardrails-lite.md` ("Never read raw query output files into AI context").
