# Phase 5 Instructions — Handoff Documentation

**Read this BEFORE `./SKILL.md`.**

**Phase 5 is OPTIONAL (after Phase 3 approved).**

---

## Phase 5 Goal

Create 4 markdown documentation files for users and operators:

1. **Architecture.md** — How the dashboard works (data flow, components, dependencies)
2. **Usage Guide.md** — How to use the dashboard (filters, KPIs, how to interpret)
3. **Runbook.md** — How to operate/troubleshoot (workflows, SINK tables, common issues)
4. **Access & Ownership.md** — Who can access, who to contact (no generic "contact your admin")

**Deliverable:** 4 markdown files saved locally, ready to share or publish

---

## Phase 5 Specific Rules (In Addition to Universal Rules)

### Rule P5-1: Architecture.md Must Show Real Data Flow

Never generic — always specific to this project.

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Architecture: [Project Name] Dashboard

## Data Flow Diagram

```
Source Tables (Treasure Data)
    ↓
[Phase 2 Workflow (if applicable)] → SINK Tables
    ↓
Phase 3 Queries
    ↓
dashboard.html (self-contained)
```

## Components

### 1. Source Tables
- **Table:** [table_name]
  - Rows: [estimated count]
  - Refresh: [frequency, e.g., "daily at 2 AM"]
  - Last updated: [timestamp]

### 2. Phase 2 Workflow (if applicable)
- **Workflow Name:** [name]
- **Schedule:** [frequency, time, timezone]
- **Duration:** ~[Xm] per run
- **Output:** SINK tables (below)

### 3. SINK Tables (if applicable)
- **Table:** [project_slug]_sink_[group]
  - Columns: [list]
  - Updated by: Workflow (scheduled)
  - Used by: Phase 3 queries

### 4. Dashboard Queries
- **Query 1:** [description]
  - Source: [SINK table or source table]
  - Aggregation: [e.g., "SUM(revenue) by region"]
  
- **Query 2:** [description]
  - Source: [table]
  - Aggregation: [...]

### 5. Dashboard HTML
- **File:** dashboard.html
- **Size:** [Xmb]
- **Data Inlined:** Yes (self-contained)
- **Deployment:** Copy to any web server or email directly
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari (modern versions)

## Dependencies

- ✓ Treasure Data account access
- ✓ Source tables exist and are populated
- ✓ (If Phase 2) Workflow running and SINK tables populated
- ✓ Network access to open dashboard.html

## Refresh Frequency

- Dashboard data is current as of: [last query run time]
- To refresh dashboard: [regenerate dashboard.html with latest data]
- Automated refresh: [only if Phase 2 workflow — state schedule]

---

## Troubleshooting

**Dashboard shows no data:**
→ Check: (1) SINK tables exist? (2) Workflow ran successfully? (3) Source data present?

**Dashboard loads slowly:**
→ Check: (1) File size (should be <5mb), (2) Browser resources, (3) Network latency

**Numbers don't match other reports:**
→ Check: (1) Time period filter (what date range?), (2) Dimension filter (what region/segment?), (3) Metric definition (same calculation?)
```

---

### Rule P5-2: Usage Guide Must Have Real Examples

Never generic — always use actual KPIs and filters from this project.

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Usage Guide: [Project Name] Dashboard

## Overview

This dashboard shows [1-2 sentences describing what it measures and audience].

**Last updated:** [timestamp]
**Refreshed:** [frequency, e.g., "Daily at 3 AM UTC"]

---

## How to Use This Dashboard

### 1. Open the Dashboard

- Desktop: Download `dashboard.html`, double-click to open
- Mobile: Open `dashboard.html` on any smartphone (Chrome/Safari)
- Share: Email the file or upload to shared drive

### 2. KPIs (Top of Dashboard)

The dashboard shows these key metrics:

**Total Revenue:** $[X]
- What it means: Sum of all revenue for the selected period and filters
- How to interpret: Trend up = growth, trend down = decline
- Related metric: Revenue by region (see chart below)

**Unique Customers:** [X]
- What it means: Number of distinct customers (deduplicated)
- How to interpret: Steady = retention, up = growth, down = churn
- Related metric: New customers (see chart below)

**Conversion Rate:** [X]%
- What it means: (Conversions / Sessions) × 100
- How to interpret: Industry benchmark is [Y]%
- Note: Includes all channels (web + mobile)

### 3. Filters

Use filters to slice the data:

**Region Filter:** Select one or more regions
- Options: [list: US, EU, APAC, etc.]
- Default: All regions
- Effect: Updates all charts below filter

**Date Range Filter:** Select start and end dates
- Default: Last 30 days
- Min/Max: [date range in data]
- Effect: Updates KPIs and all charts

**Product Category Filter:** Select one or more categories
- Options: [list: Electronics, Apparel, etc.]
- Default: All categories
- Effect: Updates revenue chart and conversion rate

### 4. Charts

**Revenue by Region (Line Chart)**
- What it shows: Daily revenue trend for each region
- How to use: Hover over line to see exact date/value
- Interpretation: Peaks = high-demand days, valleys = slow periods

**Customer Acquisition (Bar Chart)**
- What it shows: New customers by week
- How to use: Click legend to hide/show specific channels
- Interpretation: Wider bars = stronger acquisition

**Conversion Funnel (Table)**
- What it shows: Sessions → Leads → Customers (by stage)
- How to use: Sort by column (click header)
- Interpretation: Largest drop = biggest bottleneck

### 5. Tips & Tricks

**Export to CSV:**
- Tables: Right-click → Export as CSV
- Charts: Use browser print (Cmd/Ctrl+P) → "Save as PDF"

**Share a specific view:**
- Apply filters, then copy `dashboard.html` + send to colleague
- They will see the same dashboard (but filters reset on their copy)

**Spot-check numbers:**
- For exact values, query the database directly:
  ```sql
  SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales_revenue 
  WHERE date >= '2026-07-01' AND region = 'US'
  ```

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Why are my numbers different from [other report]?**
A: Likely cause: Different time period, different dimension filter, or different metric definition. Compare (1) date ranges, (2) filters applied, (3) metric calculation.

**Q: Can I download historical data?**
A: Yes. The dashboard shows the last 30 days by default. Extend the date range in the filter to go further back (up to [max_date]).

**Q: Can I add my own metrics?**
A: The dashboard is read-only (self-contained HTML). To add metrics, we'd need to regenerate it with new data. Contact [owner name].

**Q: Is this real-time?**
A: No. The dashboard data is current as of the last refresh ([last_refresh_time]). For real-time access, use [agent name] conversational agent (if available) or query Treasure Data directly.
```

### Rule P5-3: Runbook Must Have Real Names & Procedures

Never "contact your admin" — always specific owner name and escalation path.

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Runbook: [Project Name] Dashboard

## Overview

This runbook documents operational procedures for maintaining the dashboard.

**Owner:** [Name] ([email])
**Backup Owner:** [Name] ([email])
**Escalation:** [Team/Slack channel]

---

## Daily Operations

### Monitor Dashboard Health

**Check every morning (or via alert):**

1. Verify workflow ran successfully
   ```bash
   tdx wf show [project_slug]-dashboard
   ```
   - Expected: Last attempt = yesterday
   - Status = SUCCESS
   
2. Verify SINK tables are fresh
   ```bash
   tdx query "SELECT MAX(date) FROM [project_slug]_sink_metrics"
   ```
   - Expected: Yesterday's date (or latest data date)
   - If NULL or stale: Investigate workflow logs

3. Spot-check a KPI
   ```bash
   tdx query "SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales_revenue WHERE DATE(event_time) = CURRENT_DATE"
   ```
   - Compare against dashboard KPI
   - If 1% off or more: Investigate query

**If all healthy:** No action needed.
**If issue detected:** Go to Troubleshooting (below).

---

## Weekly Maintenance

**Every Monday:**

1. Review workflow execution history (last 7 days)
   ```bash
   tdx workflow:result show [project_slug]-dashboard --limit 7
   ```
   - Any failures? → Go to troubleshooting
   - All SUCCESS? → Continue

2. Review SINK table growth
   ```bash
   tdx query "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [project_slug]_sink_metrics"
   ```
   - Growth reasonable (e.g., 7 new days)? → OK
   - No growth or excessive growth? → Investigate

3. User feedback
   - Check Slack channel for issues/requests
   - Any recurring questions? → Update Usage Guide

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Workflow did not run today"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check workflow status
tdx wf show [project_slug]-dashboard

# Check last run logs
tdx workflow:result show [project_slug]-dashboard
```

**Common causes:**
1. **Treasure Data was down** → Wait and re-run manually
2. **SQL error in workflow** → Check error message, fix SQL, redeploy
3. **Authentication failed** → Verify API key is valid

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Manually re-run workflow
tdx wf run [project_slug]-dashboard

# Monitor progress
tdx workflow:result show [project_slug]-dashboard --follow
```

**If still failing:** Escalate to [Team name] (see owner contact above).

---

### Issue: "Dashboard numbers are wrong"

**Diagnosis:**
1. Query the source table directly
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM sales_revenue 
   WHERE DATE(event_time) = '2026-07-22'
   ```

2. Compare against SINK table
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM [project_slug]_sink_metrics 
   WHERE date = '2026-07-22'
   ```

3. Check if they match (exactly)

**Possible causes:**
- **Join fan-out:** SINK table has inflated numbers
- **Missing filter:** Source query missing WHERE clause
- **Data quality issue:** NULL values, duplicates
- **Stale dashboard:** Regenerate HTML to pick up latest data

**Resolution:**
1. If SINK mismatch: Rerun Phase 2 workflow
   ```bash
   tdx wf run [project_slug]-dashboard
   ```
2. If source mismatch: Debug the workflow SQL (reach out to [owner])
3. Regenerate dashboard.html:
   ```bash
   node render.js  # Fetch latest data + rebuild HTML
   ```

---

### Issue: "Workflow is too slow / too expensive"

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check workflow cost
tdx workflow:result show [project_slug]-dashboard
# Look for "Query cost" in last run
```

**Common causes:**
- Query scans too much data (no partition pruning)
- Join on unindexed column
- Missing pre-aggregation

**Resolution:**
1. Add partition pruning to workflow SQL
   ```sql
   WHERE TD_TIME_RANGE(time, '{{start_time}}', '{{end_time}}')
   ```
2. Pre-aggregate before joins
3. Reduce retention period (e.g., keep last 90 days vs 1 year)

**If optimization unclear:** Escalate to [owner].

---

## Emergency Procedures

### "Dashboard is not updating (critical issue)"

**Immediate action:**

1. Check if Treasure Data is operational
   - Visit: https://status.treasuredata.com
   - If DOWN: Wait for service restore, no action needed

2. Manually trigger workflow
   ```bash
   tdx wf run [project_slug]-dashboard
   ```

3. Monitor for completion
   ```bash
   tdx workflow:result show [project_slug]-dashboard --follow
   ```

4. If workflow succeeds: Regenerate dashboard.html
   ```bash
   node render.js
   ```

5. If workflow fails: Check error logs and escalate

**Stakeholder communication:**
- Notify [Slack channel] of status
- Provide ETA for resolution
- Post update every 30 minutes
